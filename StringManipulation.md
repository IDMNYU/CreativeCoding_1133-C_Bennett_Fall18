Sketch 5 Possibility: String Manipulations 


1. take a story from [GutenBerg](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/en)
2. Look over the data.... What would you like to pull out of it? Do you want to look for the number of times a particular word appears? Words that rhyme? Pull out every 3 word of a sentence?
This will be the data you use to generate a new piece, poem, data visualization, etc.
3. Use at least 4 expressions to parse the string of text for the precise data you need. Use [the RegExr site](http://regexr.com/) as guide to formulate your expressions
4. Pull this text into P5 or Processing, using your expressions
4. visualize your data in some interesting way.
